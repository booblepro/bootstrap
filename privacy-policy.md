## **How can you exercise your rights?**

<a href="mailto:bootstrapstartercom@gmail.com?subject=GDPR%20Request&body=">Contact us</a> with your GDPR request. 
In most circumstances, our Company will provide subjects with a copy of the information they request free of charge. However, we are permitted to charge a "reasonable fee" when a request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive.

The fee must be based on the administrative cost of providing the information.

An alternative solution for excessive, unfounded or repetitive requests is to refuse to comply. In such case we will explain to the individual why we're refusing to comply, and let them know of their right to appeal to the organisation's supervisory authority.


## **California Online Privacy Protection Act**
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. See more [here](http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf).

According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
- Users can visit our site anonymously.

## **COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)**
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

We do not market to children under the age of 13 years old.
